                Jennifer Joanna Aniston (born February 11, 1969) is an American actress and producer. The daughter of
                actors John Aniston and Nancy Dow, she began working as an actress at an early age with an uncredited
                role in
                the 1988 film Mac and Me; her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy Leprechaun. Since her
                career progressed in the 1990s, she has become one of the world's highest-paid actresses.

                her in the

                <br><br>
                She has
                since played starring roles in numerous dramas, comedies and romantic comedies. Her biggest box office

                (2011), Horrible Bosses (2011), and We're the Millers (2013), each of which grossed over $200 million in
                worldwide box office receipts. Some of her most critically acclaimed film roles include Office Space
                (1999), The Good Girl (2002), Friends with Money (2006), Cake (2014), and Dumplin' (2018). She returned
                to television in 2019, producing and starring in the Apple TV+ drama series The Morning Show, for which
                she won another Screen Actors Guild Award.
                Aniston has been included in numerous magazines' lists of the world's most beautiful women. Her net

                whom she married in 2015 and separated from in 2017.

                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279113/">The Good Girl (2002)</a>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Written by the always-brilliant Mike White and directed by his frequent collaborator Miguel Arteta,
                    this wonderful independent dark dramedy is the best-ever big-screen showcase of Aniston’s unique,
                    layered talents. She dazzles as a trapped, lonely small-town discount store employee who falls for a
                    restless coworker (Jake Gyllenhaal). The Good Girl is biting and hilarious, and also poignant and
                    sweet. Aniston masters all of the emotional terrain.

                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0129167/">The Iron Giant (1999)</a>
                </li>
                <p>
                    A critically adored box-office dud in 1999, Brad Bird‘s directorial debut is now considered an
                    essential family classic. The Iron Giant is an animated sci-fi picture about a boy who befriends a
                    gigantic metal robot from space. Aniston’s voice work brings warmth, humor and heart to the role of
                    the boy’s mother.
                </p>

                </li>
                <p>
                    If you can believe it, Mike Judge‘s workplace comedy, about software company employees who hate
                    their jobs, was a box-office disappointment when it came out. Thanks in part to a TV rediscovery on
                    Comedy Central, Office Space has since become an oft-referenced and much-memed cult classic. Aniston
                    is completely hilarious here. She shows a lot of flair.
                </p>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1499658/">Horrible Bosses (2011)</a>
                </li>
                <p>
                    Aniston really gets to let her hair down in this raunchy dark crime comedy opposite Jason Bateman,
                    Charlie Day, Colin Farrell, Jason Sudeikis and Jamie Foxx. She sinks her teeth into the part of a
                    sexually aggressive dentist, and she insisted on wearing a brown wig so the character looked
                    different than any other role she’d played. Horrible Bosses is a really funny movie, and it was a
                    big hit. Still, there’s no doubt Aniston is the best part of the enterprise, and she’s what you
                    remember long after you’ve watched it.

                <p>
                    Nicole Holofcener makes some of the finest, most perceptive modern films about what real women’s
                    lives look like. Though it’s not on the same level as her Lovely and Amazing or Enough Said, this
                    friendship dramedy has plenty of truth bombs and humor. Aniston plays a cash-strapped maid who
                    envies the security of her well-off friends, played by Catherine Keener, Joan Cusack and Frances
                    McDormand.

                </li>
                <p>
                    Based on a true story and a bestselling memoir, Marley & Me stars Aniston and Owen Wilson as
                    newlyweds who adopt a yellow Labrador pup named Marley. The dog causes plenty of mischief, and
                    also–as dogs do–brings out the very best in his family. This sweet family film struck a chord, and
                    was a behemoth at the U.S. holiday season box office.

                    Based on Elmore Leonard‘s novel The Switch, this underrated comedic crime picture, about a botched
                    kidnapping, features characters who appeared in Quentin Tarantino‘s Jackie Brown (based on Leonard’s
                    Rum Punch).

                    Though this addiction drama was met with mixed reviews, Aniston’s performance as a woman
                    long-suffering from chronic pain was widely hailed. She earned Golden Globe and SAG Awards
                    nominations. If the movie were as good as the performance, it’s easy to fathom an Oscar nod would
                    have happened.

                </li>
                <p>
                    With a first-rate cast that also includes Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, and a great
                    high-concept premise (an everyman obtains the almighty powers of God), Bruce Almighty should have
                    been flat-out great. Instead, it’s a pleasurable, occasionally corny comedy with good performances
                    and some truly hilarious bits. It was a smash hit, grossing nearly half a billion dollars.
                </p>

                    <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120772/"> The Object of My Affection (1998)

                </li>
                <p>
                    In this hit dramedy, Aniston plays a social worker who falls in love with her gay friend (Paul
                    Rudd). The movie doesn’t go as deep as it should into the themes it deals with, and not everything
                    about it has aged gracefully, but as in Wanderlust, these stars’ chemistry and charms are a pleasure
                    to witness.
